# Remember
- We need to run patch package if we edit something in the react-native-calendars folder

# What to do next
- Create some dummy data we can use to create the UI/UX
- Break out some of the stuff in HomeScreen it is getting way too long
- Research what type of database to use and how to get it setup to collect user data
  - Do we want a local storage database? Is that possible for what we want to be able to do?
  - Do we want to just make a database using Laravel and Docker like we have in the past?
- Setup interface to collect and store user data
- Figure out how to display the stored data from the user
  - Decide how we want that data to be displayed in each screen
- Finish adding the todo list for each screen
- Add a fade transition between tabs
- Don't allow user to go into landscape view
- Check how app looks and runs on android
- Check if the user settings for large text breaks the styling (we disabled large text in NoteWorthy for this reason)

# HomeScreen TODO
- Main
  - Add an image of a pile of money or something
  - Add a button to open the "Add Tips" modal
