### How to Run the App

# navigate to folder and run `npx react-native start` to start Metro

# open a new tab and run `npm run iPhone13` or `npm run 12mini` to run the simulator for the desired device

### Cocoapods and pod install

- When you install a package you generally need to run pod install afterward. To do so run `npx pod-install ios`
  - You don't have to cd into the ios folder to run this command

### Console log in Metro
- Run this command to see console logs in the Metro tab `npx react-native log-ios`
    - I am not sure if this is even required anymore. It may show logs there without running this command
